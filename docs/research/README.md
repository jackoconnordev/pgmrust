# Research docs goal

If I am going to create a libary crate for probabilistic graphical models I need to know:

- How to create a good API
- How to create a library
- What functionality do I need for PGMs
- What are PGMs good at
- How to write good documentation
- Rust toolchain
  - Benchmarks
  - Testing
  - Docs
  - CI/CD

## Scrapbook of ideas

- A module for creating and using PGMs
- A module for evaluating model performance
- A module for visualising PGMs and model performance
- An examples folder
- Find benchmark datasets/tests
- Get inspired (probably heavily) by PGMpy
- Serialize graphs
